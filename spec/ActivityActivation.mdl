    By activating a specific Activity in a Workspace the user chooses the context where
    changes to the filesystem will be recorded. Only one activity can be active at any point
    in time in a specific workspace. Both the activation and deactivation are intentional (the
    user must issue a command for this to occur).
    The cli client updates accordingly the SCM_ACTIVITY_ID and SCM_ACTIVITY_CAPTION environment variables with the Activity identifier
    so for convenience the user can issue a prompt $p [%SCM_ACTIVITY_ID%]$g or the corresponding one for the caption
    or a combination of both and have the console
    inform him about the current activity at all times. E.g. `C:\Users\DanielR [ACT-bc3f1d - Refactor sync functions]>`
    The cli client only allows for one activity to be referenced for activation so multiple activities cannot
    be active at the same time. If an activity was active and a the activation of a different one is requested,
    the old one is deactivated and the requested one is set to active.

    If a checkpoint is requested and no activity is active the system notifies the user and aborts the request.
