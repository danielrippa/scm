  Since this is a centralized system, at checkpoint time the system knows if userB is making changes to
  files being also changed by userA and is able to send notifications to both of them so they are aware
  that it is convenient that they start communicating over these changes and decide on the strategy
  to follow so when the activity relocations occur, they do so in the least disruptive way for both sides.

  The system encourages frequent communication and collaboration between users, in special over these
  kind of situations to avoid or minimize future collisions.
